		<br>
		You hear it in the radio player on this site and can download it on <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/taikes2" target="_blank">CDbaby</a>.<br>
		<br>
		Since the beginning of 2009 we have spent numerous days in the studio, working on our new CD with working title "Apologize to all your friends". At first it wasn't part of the plan to release a single but after many requests from you, longing for new material, this is the result.
		<br>
		Regarding the upcoming CD it will take a while longer, since we in the band want to make sure that the result is to everybody's satisfaction before it can be presented.
		<br>
		There are a few people we would like to send an extra thanks to for helping  us with important work in the finishing of the single and promo pictures.<br>
		<br>
		Marcus Daun - Artist<br>
		<br>
		Hans Björkman - Photographer (<a href="http://www.fotosidan.se/member/view.htm?ID=58813" target="_blank">fotosidan</a>)<br>
		<br>
		Emilie Larsson - Make-up artist (<a href="http://www.makeupfox.com" target="_blank">www.makeupfox.com</a>)<br>
		<br>
		If you have any comments or thoughts about the new single Bones or the homepage layout, please let us know, either in the guestbook or by sending an e-mail to info@taikes.com.<br>
		<br>
		Thank you for listening!`
